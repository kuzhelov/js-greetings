## Function invocation

### Call with not sufficient number of arguments

* when there are insufficient arguments being provided to a function call all those unspecified parameters will be bound to `undefined`.

* with argument names of variables that were not defined before invocation it will result in error. However, refering to `this` in a global scope will result in binding to a `global` object.
